# Texas Kayaking Excursions
This is a repository of information related to locations to kayak within Texas.
It has a secondary focus on kayak fishing, as many of the kayakers contributing
to this repository also fish.

## Taxonomy
Waters are classified by region, type (coastal, river, lake), body (river name,
lake name, etc...) and location (river stretch, lake area, etc...).  The thought
being that people will probably be looking for water close to their home and
then have an idea of what type of water they want to kayak.  With those choices,
you will have a list of locations offering the water types you want within
close proximity.

## Regions
We've decided to use the [Texas Parks & Wildlife Regions of Texas](http://tpwd.texas.gov/kids/about_texas/regions/)
as our top-level of taxonomy.  The regions are:

* Big Bend Country
* Gulf Coast
* Hill Country
* Panhandle Plains
* Pinewoods
* Prairies and Lakes
* South Texas Plains

## Water Types
The various types of water found at a destination.  They may require different
equipment and/or skills.

* **Coastal**: Bays, sloughs, river deltas, flats, beyond the breakers, etc...
Anything where you are fishing open water that is at least brackish.
* **Rivers**: Rivers, creeks, tailwaters, etc...  Anything with flowing water
that may include rapids.
* **Lakes**: Lakes, ponds, reservoirs, etc... Open, fresh water with little or
no current.
